"Along with the Interior department, the yacht crew job of Head Chef is an extremely important role as the owner and guests will always remember the food they had, regardless of the size of the yacht. The Head Chef is in responsible for the gallery. Chefs working on a Superyacht will usually have previous experience working at a hotel, restaurant, resort or cruise line. They must hold health standard certifications, have a vast knowledge of produce, diets, allergies, hygiene, food safety and storage, and the ability to provision to a budget in different parts of the world. Special menus and varied dietary requests aren’t uncommon, so you must be able to create inventive and balanced menus with scarce supplies. It is very challenging as Head Chefs will have to plan all meals and anticipate other culinary requests. They are in charge of planning meals, maintaining an inventory of all galley equipment and food, as well as galley safety and sanitation standards, purchasing ingredients, preparing food and final presentation, and ensuring that the galley is kept in pristine condition. Sous Chefs are found in larger yachts, who work alongside the Head Chef, bearing all responsibility and assisting the Head Chef when necessary, as well as cooking for the crew. In some cases, the Sous Chef takes on a dual position as a crew cook, or a “Stew-Cook” where a Steward(ess) will take on the responsibility as a Steward(ess) and a cook. This is very common on smaller sized yachts, to funnel responsibilities of both a cook and steward into one.","Along with the Interior department, the yacht crew job of Head Chef is an extremely important role as the owner and guests will always remember the food they had, regardless of the size of the yacht.
